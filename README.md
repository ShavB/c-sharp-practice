## Encapsualtion
Encapsulation is a fundamental part of oop it promotes code modularity and integrity of the data.
It involves binding or bundling of data(fields,properties) along with their Behaviours(Methods) into single unit called Class. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of the components of objects and exposes only the required functionalities to outside world.

We can achieve (#Encapsulation) by using access modifiers like private and protected and we provide control access of the data using getters and settersmethods.
