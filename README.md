- [Encapsulation](#Encapsulation)
- [Abstraction](#Abstraction)

## Encapsualtion
    Encapsulation is a fundamental part of oop it promotes code modularity and integrity of the data.
    It involves binding or bundling of data(fields,properties) along with their Behaviours(Methods) into single unit called Class. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of the components of objects and exposes only the required functionalities to outside world.

    We can achieve (#Encapsulation) by using access modifiers like private and protected and we provide control access of the data using getters and setter methods.

## Abstraction
    Abstraction involves hiding the implementation of the functionalities and show only the required functionalities to the outside world which the user can use.
    It promotes data security, simplicity and reduces complexity of the code.

    Eg. When you drive we just have to know how use pedals and streering of the car and rest is taken care of. We don't have to know anything about how the engines works.

    We can achieve abstraction using interface and abstract class.
